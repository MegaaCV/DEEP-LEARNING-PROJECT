# Description of my task

This project implements an Deep Learning image classification pipeline using PyTorch, leveraging the lightweight and efficient SqueezeNet architecture. The system begins by accepting a folder of unlabeled images, where it extracts deep visual features using a pretrained SqueezeNet model. These features are then clustered using the KMeans algorithm to generate labels, effectively simulating labeled data. The classifier is trained on this labeled dataset to learn meaningful image representations. After training, users can provide a new image, and the model will predict the cluster or class it belongs to. The project also includes result visualization through a correlation matrix and bar graph, aiding in interpreting the clustering performance and class distribution. This pipeline is highly beneficial for scenarios where labeled data is scarce, providing a scalable and automated solution for organizing and understanding image datasets.
